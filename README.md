## Food Truck Project

### Week 2 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

## Overview 

Users will input and rate a list of food trucks, then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck.

#### Structure

Define a `FoodTruck` class with fields for a unique numeric id, a name ("TacoRific", "Mediterranean Medic", etc.), food type ("Tacos", "Falafel", etc.), and a numeric rating.

Create a separate class with a `main` method that starts the program.  It will have an array to store up to five `FoodTruck` objects.  

The `main` method of this class is the only `static` method in the entire project.

## User Stories

#### User Story #1

The user is prompted to input the name, food type, and rating for up to five food trucks.  For each set of input, a `FoodTruck` object is created, its fields set to the user's input, and it is added to the array.  The truck id is not input by the user, but instead assigned automatically in the `FoodTruck` constructor from a static field that is incremented as each truck is created.

#### User Story #2

If the user inputs `quit` for the food truck name, input ends immediately and the program continues.

#### User Story #3

After input is complete, the user sees a menu from which they can choose to:

* List all existing food trucks.
* See the average rating of food trucks.
* Display the highest-rated food truck.
* Quit the program.

#### User Story #4

After choosing a menu item, the user sees the menu again and can choose another item until the choose to quit.
